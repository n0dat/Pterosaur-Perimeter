CAVE / ROCK PLATFORM PACK
Hello, and thanks for purchasing the Cave Pack. Hopefully you will have as much fun putting your cave environment together as I did creating the pack. Please let me know if you something isn’t working correctly or if something in the asset pack is not as expected. I will do my best to correct any problems or help with anything that you may need.
	The items in this pack were all hand drawn first and then scanned into my computer. Each Scanned piece of artwork was redone in a vector drawing program and some were further edited in a photo manipulating program such as GIMP or Photoshop. Much time and care has gone into making this pack. It is my very first asset store item, so I am not expecting things to be perfect. With that being said, please let me know if you need the sprites in a specific image size, or if you want something to be redone. 
	I know art can be kind of tricky sometimes. Each project has specific needs and specific art styles. If there is anything I can do to help with this pack or any of your game art needs please let me know.
